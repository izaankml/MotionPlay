# MotionSnek
This is our submission to SwampHacks 2019. Its a Gesture-Based browser game that builds on a version of tron.

## What is SwampSnek?
SwampSnek is a motion controlled browser game that lets the user play a game of tron simply by moving their hand around on their webcam. No installation of any software is required nor even any active internet connection, all the user needs to do is load up the webpage and they are able to play to their heart's content.

# Backstory
Once upon a time, in a swamp in Gainsville, three young boy-os set out on a mission: To find the best space snek (snake) of them all. To do this, a game was invented, but this was no ordinary game. 

# How we built it
SwampSnek implements Tracking.js, a computer vision library that processes everything on the client sde rather than server-side like OpenCV allowing us to have computer vision on the web. We built the website using Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3 and created the Tron game in Javascript as well. We used Tracking.js to keep track of a certain color from the user's camera, with the user having the same color token to use as a "controller" and as they moved the token they could control the game.
